            The tradition goes back to the Akan tribe: to name their children by the day of their birth. However, Ghanaian names have an even deeper meaning. We take you into this culture and show you as well your Ghanaian name!
            
            The Ghanaian culture cannot be considered a uniform one. Rather, it consists of hundreds of different ethnic influences and tribes who speak their own dialects and their own languages, having different cultural backgrounds. However, the different Ghanaian ethnic groups largely share one common belief: the naming of their children.
